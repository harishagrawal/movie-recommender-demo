Based on the code snippet for the `get_rating` function, which receives a `film_id` as an input and generates a rating, the following test scenarios can be defined to validate the business logic without considering varying input data types:

### Test Scenarios to Validate `get_rating` Function:

1. **Verify Correct Rating Range When MD5 Hash Contains [3]:**
   - Description: Ensure that when the MD5 hash of the film ID contains the digit '3', the function returns a rating in the range [1, 2].
   - Input: film_id that generates an MD5 hash containing the digit '3'.
   - Expected Output: The rating should be either 1 or 2.

2. **Verify Correct Rating Range When MD5 Hash Does Not Contain [3]:**
   - Description: Ensure that when the MD5 hash of the film ID does not contain the digit '3', the function returns a rating in the range [3, 5].
   - Input: film_id that generates an MD5 hash not containing the digit '3'.
   - Expected Output: The rating should be either 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Verify Consistent Results for Same Film ID:**
   - Description: Verify that multiple invocations of the `get_rating` function with the same `film_id` consistently return the same rating range due to deterministic MD5 hash generation.
   - Input: A constant `film_id`.
   - Expected Output: The rating range remains the same across multiple invocations.

4. **Verify Different Film IDs Produce Different Ratings:**
   - Description: Confirm that using different `film_id`s results in ratings that are not identical when the respective MD5 hashes do or do not contain the digit '3'.
   - Input: Two different `film_id`s, one expected to fall in the [1, 2] range and another in the [3, 5] range based on their MD5 hashes.
   - Expected Output: Ratings are appropriately different according to the ranges defined by their MD5 hashes.

5. **Verify Extremely Large Film ID Handling:**
   - Description: Assess how the function handles exceptionally large `film_id` values and ensure rating is still within defined ranges.
   - Input: An exceedingly large `film_id`.
   - Expected Output: The rating should still be either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as appropriate, despite the `film_id` size.

6. **Verify Negative Film ID Handling:**
   - Description: Although Python is not typed and the specification is not to include varying input data types, we must ensure that the functional contract is adhered to and specified inputs (presumably numerical IDs) are correctly used; entropy of the hash could be different with negative numbers.
   - Input: A negative `film_id`.
   - Expected Output: The rating should remain valid and within expected ranges.

7. **Verify Zero and Near-Zero Film ID Handling:**
   - Description: Test the behavior of the function with a `film_id` of zero or close to zero, which could represent edge cases.
   - Input: `film_id` of 0 or nearing 0 (e.g., 0.0001 if floating points are allowed).
   - Expected Output: The rating should be valid and consistent with the expected range based on the hash generated.

8. **Verify Handling of Sequential Film IDs:**
   - Description: Inspect the output for a sequence of `film_id`s that are incremented by 1 to verify if there is any unintended pattern in ratings.
   - Input: Sequential `film_id`s (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).
   - Expected Output: Ratings should appear random and conform to the logic defining the ranges without showing a predictable pattern.

9. **Boundary Testing for First Possible Appearance of '3' in MD5 Hash:**
   - Description: Confirm that the function correctly identifies the first occurrence of '3' in an MD5 hash and uses it to determine the rating range.
   - Input: `film_id`s that are known to produce '3' at different positions in the MD5 hash.
   - Expected Output: Wherever the '3' appears first should result in a rating in the [1, 2] range.

10. **Verify Distribution of Ratings for Large Sample Size:**
    - Description: Perform a statistical analysis to ensure ratings are distributed as expected over a large number of `film_id`s.
    - Input: A large sample of `film_id`s.
    - Expected Output: An approximately even distribution of ratings within the appropriate ranges for the IDs that have MD5 hashes with or without the digit '3'.

These test scenarios are based on the assumption that input data will be provided for various `film_id`s, and the function's behavior will be checked against the known properties of MD5 hashes and specified behavior. The randomness introduced by `random.randrange` is deterministic for a given hash, but across different `film_id`s, it would appear pseudo-random. Test scenarios must verify that the business logic remains consistent regardless of input values.
