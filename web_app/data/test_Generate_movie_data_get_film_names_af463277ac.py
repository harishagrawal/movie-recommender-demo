"""
Based on the provided code snippet for the function `get_film_names`, here are various test scenarios to validate the business logic without actually writing test code or focusing on input data types:

1. **Valid URL with Expected Content Structure**
   - Validate that the given URL points to a page with the expected HTML structure containing a table with "Opening" headers and the function returns the correct film names with years and URLs for films released in the input year.

2. **Valid URL with No Films Released in the Input Year**
   - Ensure that the function handles pages with no film data for the specified year correctly and returns an empty dictionary.

3. **Valid URL with Unexpected Content Structure**
   - Verify that the function correctly handles a page where the "Opening" headers are present but the table structure is different than expected, for example, no 'td' elements with 'rowspan' attributes or missing 'a' elements with film titles.

4. **Valid URL with Films Missing Hyperlinks**
   - Confirm that the function handles film entries that do not have hyperlinks ('a' tags), implying that it only processes films with 'a' tags correctly.

5. **Invalid URL**
   - Ensure that the function gracefully handles invalid URLs by either returning an empty dictionary or raising an appropriate exception.

6. **URL pointing to Nonexistent Page**
   - Ensure that the function handles the scenario where the URL points to a 404 page or other client/server error status properly.

7. **Timeout or Slow Response from URL**
   - Test how the function behaves if the request to the URL times out or the server response is very slow, ensuring it either gracefully fails or allows for specifying a timeout.

8. **Year in the Future**
   - Verify how the function works with a year that is in the future and thus would not have any film data available, ensuring it returns an empty dictionary.

9. **Handling Special Characters in Film Names**
   - Validate the correct handling of film names that contain special characters, ensuring they are correctly encoded in the film_id.

10. **Mix of Films with and without Hyperlinks**
    - Test a scenario where the data contains a mix of films with and without hyperlinks, ensuring that the films with hyperlinks are processed and returned correctly.

11. **Correct Population of Film URLs**
    - Confirm that the URLs for film titles are populated correctly, including the base path and any query parameters that might be within the 'href' attribute.

12. **Handling Redirects in URLs**
    - Verify that the function properly follows redirects if the Wikipedia page for a film has been moved or redirected.

13. **Verifying Film ID Uniqueness**
    - Check that the film IDs are unique and correctly formatted with their year, to avoid overwriting in case the same film name appears more than once.

Each of these scenarios targets different aspects of the function `get_film_names`. They focus on validating the parsing logic, network communication, error handling, and ensuring that the output is as expected given the conditions of the input.
