"""
Here are several test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `get_film_names(url, year)` function:

1. **Valid URL and year with expected data**: Pass a URL that points to a well-formatted Wikipedia film list page for the given year and check if the returned dictionary correctly maps all film names with the respective URLs and appends the year to the film name.

2. **Valid URL and year with no film data**: Use a URL for a Wikipedia page that is correctly structured but contains no film data for the specified year in the expected table format, and verify that the function returns an empty dictionary.

3. **Valid URL and year with partial film data**: Provide a URL that points to a Wikipedia page where some films don't have a corresponding URL (e.g., missing `href` attribute), and ensure that only the films with complete data are returned in the dictionary.

4. **Invalid URL**: Use an invalid URL to ensure that the function can handle network errors gracefully, such as connection timeout or DNS failure.

5. **Missing 'Opening' table header in HTML**: Use a URL for a Wikipedia page that is missing the "Opening" table headers to validate that the function returns an empty dictionary because it can't locate the proper table.

6. **Handling redirects**: Pass a URL that redirects to the actual Wikipedia film list page, and check if the function still successfully retrieves the film data despite the initial redirect.

7. **Multiple 'Opening' table headers**: Provide a URL for a page with multiple "Opening" table headers that represent different tables to ensure the function aggregates the film names from all relevant tables and does not stop after the first match.

8. **Year formatting in film names**: Confirm that for any film name collected from the HTML, the year provided to the function is formatted correctly within the returned dictionary keys (e.g., "Film Name (Year)").

9. **Year mismatch between URL and parameter**: Use a URL that is structured for a different year than the one passed as a parameter, to check if the function enforces the year parameter in the output despite the HTML content.

10. **Special characters in film names and URLs**: Use a URL leading to a page containing film names or URLs with special characters to ensure that they are correctly handled and represented in the output.

11. **URL leading to a non-Wikipedia page**: Pass a URL that points to a well-structured HTML table on a non-Wikipedia site and verify whether the function is still capable of extracting movie data if structured similarly.

12. **URL leading to non-HTML content**: Pass a URL that leads to other types of content (like a JSON or XML file) to test if the function properly handles unexpected content types.

Remember, these test scenarios are designed to validate the function's business logic given the context it operates in, which is scraping film names and URLs from Wikipedia film list pages based on the year provided. When implementing the actual test code, considerations will need to be made for setting up the test environment, mocking network requests, and ensuring a deterministic and reliable test outcome.
