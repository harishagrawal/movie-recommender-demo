"""
To create test scenarios for the code snippet provided, we need to understand the function and the context it operates in. The function `get_next_user_id()` seems to interact with a Redis database to increment and retrieve the next user ID. Redis is a key-value store, and the function uses the `hincrby` command, which increments the value of a hash field by the specified number. In this case, the hash name is 'app_ids' and the field is 'user_id'.

Here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic for this function:

1. **Initial Value Test**: Check that the function returns `1` when it is called for the first time, assuming that the 'user_id' field does not exist yet in the 'app_ids' hash in Redis.

2. **Increment Test**: After the initial call, test that subsequent calls to the function return incrementally increasing values. For instance, if the first call returns `1`, the second should return `2`, and so on.

3. **Concurrent Calls Test**: Simulate multiple simultaneous calls to the function to ensure that it handles concurrent increments correctly, and each call returns a unique user ID.

4. **Persistence Test**: Verify that the increment persists between separate invocations of the function, even if the application is restarted between calls.

5. **Overflow Test**: Determine how the function behaves if the user ID counter reaches the maximum value that can be stored in the underlying data type in Redis (typically a signed 64-bit integer).

6. **Failure Handling Test**: Introduce a failure, such as disconnecting the Redis server or introducing network latency, to check how the function handles the unavailability of the Redis service.

7. **Error Response Test**: Test the function's response to Redis errors, such as when the Redis server is running out of memory, or if there are any data type issues with the 'user_id' field.

8. **Data Integrity Test**: After several increments, directly check the value in the Redis database to confirm that it matches the expected user ID value and that there are no inconsistencies.

9. **Permissions Test**: Run the function with a client that has restricted permissions to ensure it fails gracefully if the Redis user does not have the correct permissions to increment the hash field.

10. **Restart and Recovery Test**: Restart the Redis server to ensure that the function can still retrieve and increment the user ID correctly after recovery.

11. **Boundary Conditions Test**: Introduce boundary conditions like very high user ID values to ensure the function continues to operate correctly without unexpected behavior.

12. **Large Volume Test**: Test the function with a large volume of calls to ensure performance remains stable and there are no issues with data corruption or loss under load.

These scenarios would require creating an appropriate test harness that can mock or interact with a real Redis instance to validate the behavior of `get_next_user_id()`.
