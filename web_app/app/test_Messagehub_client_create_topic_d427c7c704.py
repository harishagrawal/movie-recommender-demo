"""
Based on the provided code snippet, here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `create_topic` function within `messagehub_client`. These scenarios assume that we have some means of configuring and observing the behavior of the Message Hub (such as Kafka), as well as the function's environment.

1. **Config Feature Flag**
   - Verify that when `MESSAGEHUB_ENABLED` is set to `False`, the function immediately returns without executing any further logic.

2. **Topic Creation Path**
   - Given `MESSAGEHUB_ENABLED` is `True`, and the topic named in `app.config['KAFKA_TOPIC']` does not already exist, verify that the function successfully creates a new topic using the configured `KAFKA_ADMIN_URL` and `KAFKA_API_KEY`.
   - Ensure that the `X-Auth-Token` is correctly set in the headers.
   - Confirm that the `content-type` is set to `application/json` in the headers.
   - Check that the topic creation `POST` request correctly serializes the `data` as json.
   - Verify the function prints response text from the verification `GET` request.

3. **Topic Verification Path**
   - Given `MESSAGEHUB_ENABLED` is `True`, and the topic named in `app.config['KAFKA_TOPIC']` already exists, verify that the function does not attempt to recreate the existing topic.
   - Verify that the function prints response text indicating that the topic already exists.

4. **Exception Handling**
   - Verify that when an unexpected exception happens (e.g., network issues or JSON serialization problems), the function prints an error message with the exception information.
   - Confirm that the function raises the caught exception after logging it.

5. **Response Validation**
   - Verify that the function checks the status of the response after making the `POST` request and acts accordingly (though there's a TODO comment suggesting this logic is not yet implemented).

6. **Security and Authentication**
   - Given an incorrect `KAFKA_API_KEY`, verify that the function handles authentication errors gracefully.
   - Verify that all communication with the `KAFKA_ADMIN_URL` is done over a secure protocol (HTTPS).

7. **Configuration Validation**
   - Verify that the function correctly reads the topic name, API key, and admin URL from `app.config`.
   - Check that the function responds appropriately if any required configuration is missing or malformed.

8. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Verify that the function logs relevant information for monitoring purposes (not visible in the current code snippet but may be part of an actual implementation).
   - Confirm that the logs contain sufficient detail to diagnose any issues that arise during the functionâ€™s execution, including a timestamp, the request being made, and the response received.

These scenarios are based on common practices for testing critical elements of a function interacting with an external service, in this case, a Message Hub (Kafka). Each scenario helps ensure that the function behaves correctly under different conditions and handles failure states adequately.
