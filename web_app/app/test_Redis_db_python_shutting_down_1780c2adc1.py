"""
Based on the provided code snippet for the function `python_shutting_down` and the guidelines for the test scenarios, I will outline several scenarios to validate the business logic without writing any test code and without including scenarios for varying input datatypes, as Python is a dynamically typed language. Here are some test scenarios you can consider:

#### Test Scenarios for `python_shutting_down` Function

1. **Normal Execution Test**: 
   - **Objective**: Ensure that the function executes without errors and outputs the correct message.
   - **Scenario**: Call `python_shutting_down` under typical conditions.
   - **Expected Result**: The message 'Disconnecting redis client' is printed to the console.

2. **Multiple Consecutive Calls Test**:
   - **Objective**: Confirm that multiple consecutive calls to the function do not cause unexpected behavior.
   - **Scenario**: Call `python_shutting_down` consecutively multiple times.
   - **Expected Result**: Each call prints 'Disconnecting redis client' to the console, and there are no errors or state-related issues between calls.

3. **Logging Test**:
   - **Objective**: Verify that the function logs the disconnection event properly if a logging mechanism is integrated.
   - **Scenario**: Call `python_shutting_down` in an environment where logging is enabled.
   - **Expected Result**: A log entry is created for the disconnection event.

4. **Redis Client State Test**:
   - **Objective**: Check that the redis client is actually disconnected after the function is called, if redis client state is accessible.
   - **Scenario**: Call `python_shutting_down` and then check the state of the redis client.
   - **Expected Result**: The redis client should be in a disconnected state.

5. **Before and After System State Test**:
   - **Objective**: Assess whether the system state changes in any unintended way before and after the function call.
   - **Scenario**: Record system state before and after calling `python_shutting_down`.
   - **Expected Result**: No change in system state other than the disconnection of the redis client should be observed.

6. **Error Handling Test**:
   - **Objective**: Verify that the function handles errors gracefully if the redis client is already disconnected or if any other error occurs during disconnection.
   - **Scenario**: Call `python_shutting_down` when the redis client is already disconnected or simulate a disconnection error.
   - **Expected Result**: An appropriate error message is displayed or logged, and the application does not crash.

7. **Integration Test with Redis Connection**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure the function works correctly when integrated with actual code that manages a redis connection.
   - **Scenario**: Integrate `python_shutting_down` into a larger application workflow where the redis client is connected and used, then subsequently disconnected using this function.
   - **Expected Result**: The function disconnects the client smoothly without affecting the workflow of the application.

8. **System Resource Release Test**:
   - **Objective**: Confirm that all system resources related to the redis connection are released after function execution.
   - **Scenario**: Investigate system resources before and after `python_shutting_down` execution to identify any potential resource leaks.
   - **Expected Result**: All resources previously allocated to the redis client are properly released.

These scenarios provide a basis for thorough testing of the `python_shutting_down` function in various aspects of its operation and integration with a larger system.

# presumes the python_shutting_down function is in the redis_db.py file.

def test_python_shutting_down_output(capfd):
    redis_db.python_shutting_down()

    assert out == 'Disconnecting redis client\n', "The output message should match exactly."

# No additional tests are defined since the function does not interact with Redis or perform error handling.
