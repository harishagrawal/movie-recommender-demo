"""
Based on the provided code snippet for the function `create_moviedb_indexes`, the following test scenarios can be developed to validate the business logic without writing test code or considering input data types (as Python is dynamically typed):

1. **Index Creation on Fresh Database**: Verify that when the function is invoked on a fresh (newly created) database, the design document does not exist, and the function creates a new design document with the specified index.

2. **Index Update on Existing Database**: Validate that when the function is run on a database where the design document already exists, the function fetches the existing design document and updates the search index.

3. **Correct Index Properties Setup**: Ensure that when the index is created, properties like "store" for the "name" index are correctly applied as per the function's design document definition.

4. **Proper Handling of Documents Without "name" Field**: Confirm that when the index encounters documents without a "name" field, it only indexes the default "_id" and does not raise any exceptions or attempt to index an undefined "name" field.

5. **Persistence of Design Document**: After index creation or update, ensure that the design document is saved correctly in the database and that the indexes are usable for searching.

6. **Output Verification**: Check that the appropriate message ('created' or 'updated') is printed, indicating the successful creation or update of the index.

7. **Failure to Connect to Database**: Confirm how the function handles a situation where it cannot connect to the database due to network issues or incorrect database configuration.

8. **Correct Analyzer Setting**: Ensure that the analyzer parameter, even though it is set to `None` in this function, is appropriately set in the design document, considering a future requirement where a non-default analyzer might be used.

9. **Database Authentication**: Validate that the function correctly handles scenarios where authentication is required to access the database, including correct handling of authenticated sessions and error handling for failed authentication.

10. **Resiliency to Database Errors**: Test how the function behaves in the face of database errors such as timeout, disconnection, or read/write errors during the index creation process.

11. **Design Document Conflict Resolution**: In the event of a design document update conflict (e.g., when another process has updated the document concurrently), verify that the function handles it gracefully, resolving conflicts as necessary.

12. **Database Permission Checks**: Confirm that the function successfully checks for the necessary permissions to create or update design documents and handles cases where permissions are insufficient.

13. **Index Functionality Post-Creation**: After index creation, verify that it is possible to perform searches using the indexes and that the results are consistent with the documents indexed.

14. **Multiple Invocations Handling**: Ensure that invoking the function multiple times does not lead to unintended consequences, such as duplicate indexes or errors due to attempts to create already existing indexes.

These scenarios outline the primary areas to focus on to validate the logic of the function `create_moviedb_indexes`. They ensure that the function correctly and robustly handles database connectivity, index management, and error situations.
