"""
Certainly! Below are test scenarios to validate the business logic for the provided code snippet function `create_dbs`. Keep in mind these are not test code itself, but rather scenarios which describe what would be tested.

1. **Database Already Exists Scenario**:
    - Ensure that if a database listed in `CL_DBS` already exists, it outputs 'Found database' for each.

2. **Create Database Scenario**:
    - Verify that if a database listed in `CL_DBS` does not exist, it creates the database and outputs 'Created database'.

3. **Database Creation Verification**:
    - Confirm that after attempting to create a new database, the `db_handle.exists()` method returns `True` confirming the database's existence.

4. **Readable By Everyone Except Authentication DB**:
    - Check that for every newly created database except for the one named `CL_AUTHDB`, the database is made readable by everyone. Validate this by checking if the '_reader' role is properly set in the security document.

5. **Authentication Database Security**:
    - Confirm that the authentication database defined by `CL_AUTHDB` does not have the '_reader' role set for the user 'nobody', ensuring it's not readable by everyone.

6. **Problem Creating Database Notification**:
    - Simulate a condition where the database cannot be created and ensure that the code outputs 'Problem creating database'. This could be due to network issues, insufficient permissions, or other errors.

7. **Multiple Databases Creation Scenario**:
    - Test the scenario where there are multiple databases in `CL_DBS` that need to be created to ensure the loop handles multiple creations correctly.

8. **No Database Needs Creation**:
    - Test the scenario when all databases in `CL_DBS` already exist, ensuring the script only outputs 'Found database' for each and doesn't attempt creation.

9. **Dodging Creation for Databases Not in CL_DBS**:
    - Ensure that databases not listed in `CL_DBS` are neither checked nor created by the script.

10. **Empty CL_DBS List Handling**:
    - Test how the script behaves when `CL_DBS` is an empty list, both in terms of execution (no errors should be thrown) and output (nothing should be printed).

11. **Database Creation Error Handling**:
    - Ensure proper handling of exceptions or errors during database creation, possibly by mocking an error and checking that the correct message is printed.

12. **Permissions and Roles Setup**:
    - Validate that proper permissions and roles are assigned for databases that are created, by simulating user access where possible.

These scenarios can be used as a basis to write actual test cases that would include specific input data and expected results to thoroughly validate the business logic of the `create_dbs` function.
