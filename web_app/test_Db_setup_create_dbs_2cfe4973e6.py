"""
Based on the provided code snippet, here are several test scenarios that would validate the business logic of the `create_dbs` function, without involving test code or data types:

1. **All Databases Exist**: Verify when all databases listed in `CL_DBS` are already present in `cloudant_client.all_dbs()`. Expect no database creation and appropriate 'Found database' messages.

2. **No Databases Exist**: Confirm behavior when none of the databases listed in `CL_DBS` are present in `cloudant_client.all_dbs()`. Expect creation of all databases and 'Created database' messages, along with setting read permissions for all except the Authentication DB.

3. **Some Databases Exist**: Check functionality when some databases in `CL_DBS` exist and others do not. Expect creation of only missing databases and appropriate console messages for both existing and newly created databases.

4. **Authentication DB Creation**: Specifically test creating the Authentication database listed in `CL_DBS`. Ensure no public read permissions are attempted to be set on the Authentication DB.

5. **Public Read Permissions Set**: Validate that read permissions are being correctly set for all databases except the Authentication DB. This could be tested by examining the security document settings post-creation.

6. **Database Creation Failure**: Simulate failure during the creation of one or more databases, potentially by mocking the `cloudant_client.create_database` function to throw an exception or return an invalid handle. Confirm that the appropriate 'Problem creating database' messages are printed.

7. **Security Document Failure**: Simulate a failure in setting the security document for a new database (not the Authentication DB), potentially by mocking the `SecurityDocument` context manager to throw an exception. Expect that an error is logged or handled for the failure, without impacting the setup of other databases.

8. **Empty CL_DBS List**: Evaluate the behavior when `CL_DBS` is an empty list. No operations should be performed, and there should be no console messages.

9. **Non-Existing DBs in All DBs**: Test the scenario where `cloudant_client.all_dbs()` returns databases that are not in `CL_DBS`. This should not affect the creation of databases listed in `CL_DBS`.

10. **Partial Database Creation**: Ensure that if database creation is interrupted (e.g., due to an error or stoppage after some but not all databases have been created), the function can be run again and will only attempt to create the missing databases.

11. **Idempotency of Function Call**: Determine that running `create_dbs` multiple times does not create duplicate databases or attempt to reset permissions on already correctly set up databases.

12. **Case Sensitivity**: Verify the function's behavior respect to the case sensitivity of database names, by checking if database names are case-insensitively matched against `cloudant_client.all_dbs()`.

13. **Database Name Conflicts**: Confirm that if `CL_DBS` contains a database name that is a sub-string of an existing database in `cloudant_client.all_dbs()`, this doesnâ€™t lead to a false positive 'Found database' message, and database creation proceeds as expected.

Each test scenario should be crafted to determine a unique path of execution within the function and ensure that the business requirements are being met correctly.
