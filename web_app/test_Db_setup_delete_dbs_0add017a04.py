"""
Writing test scenarios involves specifying different circumstances and conditions under which the function `delete_dbs` should be tested to validate its business logic without actually writing the test code. The test scenarios for the `delete_dbs` function mentioned in the code snippet provided could include the following:

1. **Database List Integrity**: Verify that when `delete_dbs` is called, it only attempts to delete databases listed in `CL_DBS`.

2. **Existing Databases**: Test that `delete_dbs` successfully deletes databases that exist in the cloudant_client's list of databases and are also listed in `CL_DBS`.

3. **Non-Existent Databases**: Test that `delete_dbs` does not attempt to delete databases that are in `CL_DBS` but do not exist in the cloudant_client's list of databases.

4. **Correct Deletion Process**: Test that the function correctly prints "Deleting database" followed by the database name for each database it attempts to delete.

5. **Database Deletion Confirmation**: Verify that after execution of `delete_dbs`, the targeted databases are no longer present in the cloudant_client's list of databases.

6. **Empty `CL_DBS` List**: Test the function's behavior when the `CL_DBS` list is empty to see if it handles the scenario gracefully without errors.

7. **Unauthorized Access**: Test the function's response when it tries to delete a database for which the cloudant_client does not have delete permissions.

8. **Cloudant Client Connectivity**: Test how the function behaves when there is an issue with the cloudant_client's connection to the database server (i.e., network issues, server downtime, authentication problems).

9. **Deletion Error Handling**: Test the function's error handling when the cloudant_client encounters an error during the deletion process (e.g., a database is locked or in use).

10. **Multiple Calls to `delete_dbs`**: Verify that consecutive calls to `delete_dbs` works correctly and does not throw errors or attempt to delete databases that have already been removed.

11. **Partial List Deletion**: Test how the function behaves if it can delete some but not all databases listed in `CL_DBS` due to permissions or other errors.

12. **Idempotency**: Test that calling `delete_dbs` multiple times in succession does not result in errors or unexpected behavior, ensuring that the function is idempotent.

13. **Impact on Other Databases**: Verify that databases not listed in `CL_DBS` remain unaffected when `delete_dbs` is called.

14. **Logging of Deletion Activity**: Verify that the function logs the deletion activity correctly, which could be critical for auditing and troubleshooting purposes. 

15. **Large Number of Databases**: Test performance and behavior under the condition of having a very large list of databases in both `CL_DBS` and the cloudant_client's list of databases to verify scalability and robustness.

16. **Transaction Safety**: If applicable, test that the deletion process is transactionally safe, so in a failure, the system either completes all deletions or rolls back to the pre-delete state.

Each of the above scenarios would have to be converted into actual test cases with specific inputs and expected results when test code is being written. The test cases would also involve setup of the necessary conditions/environment and clean-up actions post-execution of the tests.
