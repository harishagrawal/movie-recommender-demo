"""
To validate the business logic of the `delete_dbs()` function, which appears to delete a set of predefined databases from a Cloudant client, you would need to consider scenarios where different types of outcomes are expected. Here is a list of such scenarios that could be validated without writing test code:

1. **Deletion of Existing Databases in CL_DBS list**: Verify that the function successfully deletes all databases in the `CL_DBS` list if they exist in the client's list of databases.

2. **Database not in the Cloudant Client List**: Test that the function does not attempt to delete databases that do not exist in the Cloudant client's database list.

3. **Database not in the CL_DBS list**: Ensure that databases that are not in the `CL_DBS` list are not deleted, even if they exist in the Cloudant client's database list.

4. **Empty CL_DBS list**: Confirm that the function does not delete any databases if the `CL_DBS` list is empty.

5. **Empty Cloudant Client List**: Validate that the function performs no action (or does not fail) if there are no databases in the Cloudant client's database list.

6. **Partial Intersection of CL_DBS and Cloudant Client List**: Confirm that only the databases that exist in both the `CL_DBS` list and the Cloudant client's database list are deleted.

7. **Read-only or Restricted Permission Databases**: Confirm how the function behaves when attempting to delete databases for which the client does not have delete permissions.

8. **Response to Deletion Failures**: Assess how the function handles situations where the Cloudant client's `delete_database` call fails for some databases, e.g., due to network issues or server errors.

9. **Deletion of All Databases when CL_DBS Equals the Cloudant Client List**: Ensure that all databases are deleted when the `CL_DBS` list is exactly the same as the Cloudant client's database list.

10. **Multiple Deletion Attempts**: Test that the function can be called multiple times in a row without causing errors or unexpected behavior, even if the databases have already been deleted in the first call.

11. **Log or Output Confirmation**: Check that the function provides appropriate console output for each database deletion, confirming the action was taken.

12. **Resource Consumption and Timing**: Measure if the function causes excessive resource usage or takes an unusually long time to execute.

13. **Error Handling**: Verify that the function appropriately handles any exceptions thrown by the `cloudant_client` methods, specifically ensuring it doesn't stop the deletion process for subsequent databases in the `CL_DBS` list after encountering an error.

Please note that the points mentioned above rely on understanding the context and behavior of `cloudant_client`, the `CL_DBS` list, and any potential side effects not shown in the code snippet. The actual test cases and validations would depend on the specific business rules and system requirements surrounding this functionality.

# Assuming we will have more tests for other scenarios as per the requirement such as handling deletion failures,

# However, these tests would require mocking behavior specific to those special conditions or the cloudant_client behavior.
