"""
Given the code snippet you provided, here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `populate_rating_db` function without considering varying input datatypes:

1. **Normal Scenario**: Assess the function with a valid `ratings.dat` file with proper formatting to ensure it correctly reads data, converts to integer where needed, and appends it to `bulk_docs`.

2. **Chunk Upload Verification**: Verify that the `bulk_docs` list is uploaded as chunks every 10,000 documents and that the `bulk_docs` list is reset after each upload.

3. **Maximum Request Size Validation**: Confirm that the chunks are less than 1MB size limit to avoid request size issues.

4. **Last Chunk Upload**: Ensure the last chunk of data which may not be exactly 10,000 documents is also uploaded after the loop ends.

5. **ID Generation Validation**: Test that `_id` field in the document is correctly generated in "user_{user_id}/movie_{movie_id}" format.

6. **Maximum User ID Tracking**: Ensure that the `max_user_id` correctly reflects the highest user ID in the `ratings.dat` file.

7. **Response Handling**: Validate that the code is correctly checking the response from the `bulk_docs` method for successful document saves.

8. **Print Output Checking**: Verify that the function prints the correct `chunk` and `num saved` data.

9. **REDIS_ENABLED Configuration**: When `REDIS_ENABLED` is True in the `app.config`, ensure that the `set_next_user_id` is called with the correct next user ID.

10. **File End Handling**: Verify that the function stops reading when it reaches the end of the ratings file.

11. **Empty Line Handling**: Test how the function handles empty lines within the data file; they should be ignored without causing errors.

12. **Timestamp Format**: Ensure that the timestamp is in the expected format (validation of actual format would require more information).

13. **Integrity of Data in DB**: After the population process, verify that the data in the `rating_db` matches the data provided in the `ratings.dat` file.

14. **Error Handling**: Check how the function handles exceptions such as read errors from the file or issues with the database connection.

15. **Ratings Bounds Verification**: Assuming the business logic caps ratings, assess that the `rating` value for each document falls within the expected range (e.g., 0.5 to 5 for movie ratings).

16. **Unique Document IDs**: Verify that document `_id` does not collide, causing an overwrite of existing data.

17. **Performance**: Evaluate the function for performance metrics, like how long it takes to populate the database with a large `ratings.dat` dataset.

18. **Break Condition Commented**: Check the correctness of the logic if the commented break condition is activated to only load a subset of ratings.

Please note that these scenarios assume that there is an existing cloudant database configured and there are necessary mechanisms in place for the function to interact with this database and possibly Redis if enabled. Actual input data or ranges would be necessary to validate these scenarios with test cases.
