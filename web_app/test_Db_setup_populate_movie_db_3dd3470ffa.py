"""
Sure, I can help you create test scenarios for the `populate_movie_db` function that is responsible for reading a file containing movie data and populating a movie database with that data. Here are some scenarios to consider:

1. **File Reading Success Scenario:**
   - Test that the function successfully reads from the 'movies.dat' file.
   - Expected Result: The file is read without errors.

2. **File Not Found Scenario:**
   - Test that appropriate error handling or logging is performed if the 'movies.dat' file does not exist.
   - Expected Result: An error log or message and no attempt to populate the database.

3. **Empty File Scenario:**
   - Test the function behavior when the 'movies.dat' file is empty.
   - Expected Result: No documents are created or added to the database.

4. **Corrupted Data Scenario:**
   - Test how the function handles lines that don't correctly split into three parts (movieid, moviename, url).
   - Expected Result: Lines that don't split correctly are either skipped with a warning or an error is logged.

5. **Bulk Document Creation Scenario:**
   - Test that a bulk_docs list is created with the correct structure and data types from valid input lines.
   - Expected Result: A list of dictionaries with keys '_id', 'name', 'url', and corresponding values from the file.

6. **Database Connection Scenario:**
   - Test that the function correctly obtains a handle to the 'CL_MOVIEDB' database from the cloudant_client.
   - Expected Result: A valid database object is used for adding documents.

7. **Successful Bulk Insert Scenario:**
   - Test that the function correctly performs a bulk insert of the documents into the database.
   - Expected Result: All documents are inserted into the database, and the count of successfully saved documents is printed.

8. **Partial Bulk Insert Success Scenario:**
   - Test how the function behaves when only some documents in the bulk insert are accepted by the database.
   - Expected Result: The number of successfully saved documents is correct and corresponds to 'ok' status responses only.

9. **Database Insert Failure Scenario:**
   - Test the function's behavior when the database is unreachable or the insert fails.
   - Expected Result: Appropriate error handling or logging; failed inserts should not be counted as saved.

10. **Duplicate ID Insertion Scenario:**
    - Test the behavior when the input file contains duplicate movie IDs.
    - Expected Result: The function should handle duplicates according to the database's constraints on unique IDs (either rejects duplicates or updates existing records).

11. **Transaction Handling Scenario:**
    - Test how the function deals with transactional integrity if there is an interruption (e.g., an exception is thrown in the middle of populating the database).
    - Expected Result: The function should either roll back the transaction or handle partially completed operations appropriately.

12. **Response Parsing Scenario:**
    - Test that the function accurately parses the response from the `bulk_docs` operation and correctly identifies successful and failed document insertions.
    - Expected Result: The `num_ok` variable reflects the actual number of documents that were successfully saved in the database.

Remember to validate that the output and side effects of each scenario match the expected results. These scenarios should aim to cover the normal operation, edge cases, and possible error states of the `populate_movie_db` function.
