Based on the provided code snippet for the function `create_authdb_indexes`, I will outline several test scenarios to validate the business logic without writing the actual test code. This code is intended to create or update a Cloudant database view index, particularly for the email field in documents.

### Test Scenarios for `create_authdb_indexes` Function

1. **Verify Index Creation on Empty Database**
   - Given that no design documents exist in the database,
   - When `create_authdb_indexes` is called,
   - Then verify that the view named 'authdb-email-index' is created,
   - And verify that the emitted message is 'created authdb-email-index'.

2. **Verify Index Update on Existing Design Document**
   - Given that a design document with the view 'authdb-email-index' already exists in the database,
   - When `create_authdb_indexes` is called,
   - Then verify that the existing view is updated with the new design function,
   - And verify that the emitted message is 'updated authdb-email-index'.

3. **Check Functionality with Documents Having Email Field**
   - Given that documents with the email field exist in the database,
   - When `create_authdb_indexes` is called and the index is created or updated,
   - Then verify that querying the 'authdb-email-index' returns the expected results (i.e., documents are indexed by their email fields).

4. **Check Functionality with Documents Without Email Field**
   - Given that documents without the email field exist in the database,
   - When `create_authdb_indexes` is called,
   - Then verify that querying the 'authdb-email-index' does not return these documents.

5. **Idempotency Check**
   - Given that the view 'authdb-email-index' has already been created or updated with the exact same design function,
   - When `create_authdb_indexes` is called again,
   - Then verify that the index remains unchanged,
   - And if no change to the index is required, verify the behavior of the function (whether it prints any message or not).

6. **Verify Error Handling for Database Connection Issues**
   - Given that the connection to the Cloudant database is not available,
   - When `create_authdb_indexes` is called,
   - Then verify that the function handles the connection exception properly (e.g., a try-catch block can be inferred in an actual implementation).

7. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Testing**
   - Given that the user does not have the correct permissions to create or update views in the database,
   - When `create_authdb_indexes` is called,
   - Then verify that the function produces the correct error message or handles the situation according to the business logic.

For these scenarios, it's assumed that the necessary mocks or testing frameworks are in place to simulate the Cloudant database environment. The actual implementation should handle potential exceptions and errors not captured above, which should be verified as well according to the specific application's error handling policies.

    # Additional scenarios would follow the similar pattern, involving mocking the necessary cloudant client responses and methods,
    # and then calling the function under test to check the expected behaviors.

# Scenario 3-7: Would be defined similar to Scenario 1 and 2, with appropriate mocks and assertions
