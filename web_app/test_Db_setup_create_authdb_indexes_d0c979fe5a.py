"""
Based on the provided function `create_authdb_indexes`, I will outline several test scenarios that can help validate the business logic without the need for varying input data types or actual input data. The function appears to create an index for emails in a CouchDB (Cloudant) design document within an authorization database.

1. **Index Creation Scenario**
   - **Given** that there is an `authdb` database without an existing design document for email indexing,
   - **When** `create_authdb_indexes` is executed,
   - **Then** a new design document with a view named ‘authdb-email-index’ should be created.

2. **Index Update Scenario**
   - **Given** that there is an `authdb` database with an existing design document for email indexing,
   - **When** `create_authdb_indexes` is executed,
   - **Then** the existing design document should be updated.

3. **Index Functionality Scenario**
   - **Given** that the index has been created or updated,
   - **When** a query is executed against the `authdb-email-index`,
   - **Then** the documents that contain the field `email` should be returned.

4. **Error Handling Scenario - Missing Database**
   - **Given** that the database `CL_AUTHDB` does not exist,
   - **When** `create_authdb_indexes` is executed,
   - **Then** an appropriate error should be thrown, or a specific behavior should be followed (must be defined by business logic).

5. **Design Document Integrity Scenario**
   - **Given** that a design document already exists with views other than `authdb-email-index`,
   - **When** `create_authdb_indexes` is executed,
   - **Then** the other views in the design document should remain untouched.

6. **Multiple Execution Scenario**
   - **Given** that `create_authdb_indexes` has been executed once already successfully,
   - **When** `create_authdb_indexes` is executed again,
   - **Then** it should determine that the view already exists and perform an update instead of creating a duplicate.

7. **Performance Scenario for Large Databases**
   - **Given** a large `authdb` database with a significant number of documents,
   - **When** `create_authdb_indexes` is executed,
   - **Then** the indexing process should complete within a reasonable time frame (performance benchmark must be defined by business logic).

8. **Verification Scenario for Index Correctness**
   - **Given** that the index has been created,
   - **When** the index is used to locate documents by email,
   - **Then** the index should only return documents where the `email` field matches the query, and no false positives or misses should occur.

9. **Index Consistency with Data Mutation Scenario**
   - **Given** that the index exists and documents in `authdb` have been updated with new emails,
   - **When** `create_authdb_indexes` is executed,
   - **Then** the index should be up-to-date with the latest document states showing the new emails.

10. **Documentation and Logging Scenario**
    - **Given** that `create_authdb_indexes` is designed to print messages about its actions,
    - **When** it is executed,
    - **Then** it should log its actions correctly (creation or update) to allow audits and troubleshooting.

These test scenarios are designed to validate the function's performance and behavior without relying on the variability of data types. Each scenario outlines a specific situation and the expected outcome that can be verified during testing.
